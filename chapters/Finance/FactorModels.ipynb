    "Let $r^{e,i}$ be an asset excess return over the risk-free rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $f^e$ be a traded factor, for now  the excess returns on SPY ETF\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r^{e,i}=\\alpha_i + b_{i,f}f^e+u_{i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $b_{i,f}$ is asset $i$ exposure to the factor $f$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can always write things that way--it is just a statistical decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It can be useful for measuring risk if\n",
    "    - The risk $u_{i,t}$ is specific to asset $i$ and uncorrelated with other assets\n",
    "    - I.e the factors picks up lots of the variation in stock returns \n",
    "\n",
    "2. It can be useful for measuring expected returns if\n",
    "    - The premium on the factor f, $E[f^e]$ summarize well the known \"priced\" systematic risk factors\n",
    "    - By \"priced\" we mean risk-factors that earn a risk premium  $E[f^e]>0$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call the first a factor model of risk, and the second a factor model of expected returns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alpha and Beta\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[r^i]=E[rf+r^{e,i}]=rf+E[\\alpha_i + b_{i,f}f^e+u_{i}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[r^i]=rf+\\alpha_i+b_{i,f}E[f^e]+E[u_{i}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using that $E[u_{i}]=0$ we have\n",
    "- \n",
    "$$E[r^i]=rf+\\alpha_i+b_{i,f}E[f^e]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thus, just like the risk of our asset could be attributed to the factor and it's component, the same model also allow us to decompose the expected return in terms of the risk-free rate, the premium coming from the common factor exposure $b_{i,f}E[f^e]$ and the risk-premium specific to the asset, the ALPHA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Getting exposure to the factor is a commodity. Anyone can buy SPY or many other funds that track the market very well\n",
    "  \n",
    "- In most funds, specially for portfolio managers working a pod shops like Citadel and Millenium, a portfolio manager mandate is to take no factor risk--or at least aim to be close to factor neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is all about the alpha \n",
    "\n",
    "- The alpha does not need to be in a specific asset, can be o a combination of them\n",
    "\n",
    "- The decomposition works the same for portfolio of assets\n",
