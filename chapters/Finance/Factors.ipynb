    "# What Are Factors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Factors are characteristics or signals that help explain asset returns. They serve both as **risk indicators** and as **return drivers**. Academics emphasize their ability to explain **expected returns** and remove known sources of variation so that only “new” sources of alpha remain. Practitioners value them for improving **performance measurement**, **risk management**, and **portfolio construction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can group factors based on what they aim to capture:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌍 Market & Sector Membership\n",
    "- **Market**: Whether the asset belongs to a region (e.g., US, China). Encoded as 1 if present, 0 otherwise.\n",
    "- **Sector**: Broad industry grouping (e.g., tech, healthcare). Can be split into 5 to 100+ categories. \n",
    "- Works beyond equities—applicable to credit markets, bonds, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "These “membership” factors help isolate common shocks shared within countries or sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧾 Accounting-Based Factors\n",
    "These aim to proxy for fundamentals and predict returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Value (Book-to-Market)**: Cheap stocks (high book relative to price) have historically earned higher returns. This remains one of the most studied and used factors in practice.\n",
    "- **Profitability / Quality**: Gross profitability (Revenue – COGS) / Assets helps separate high-quality stocks from deteriorating ones. Other signals include ROE, margins, earnings stability, accruals, and low debt levels.\n",
    "- **Investment**: Firms that invest less (e.g., low asset growth, low capital expenditures) tend to outperform, potentially because high investment reflects low marginal value or managerial empire-building.\n",
    "- **Composite Quality Scores**: Many practitioners combine profitability, stability, leverage, and growth into a single “quality” score for screening or weighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining quality with value is especially powerful: among firms with similar value metrics, those with high profitability tend to outperform.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📉 Return-Based Factors\n",
    "These come from past return patterns and risk exposures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Beta**: Measures sensitivity to the market factor. The CAPM suggests a linear relation between beta and expected return, but empirically this relationship often breaks down.\n",
    "- **Volatility**: High total or idiosyncratic volatility is often associated with *lower* expected returns. Low-volatility stocks have outperformed in many global markets.\n",
    "- **Short-Term Reversal**: Stocks with very poor short-term performance tend to revert upwards, likely due to liquidity shocks, overreactions, or temporary flows.\n",
    "- **Momentum**: One of the strongest factors. Past 12-month return (excluding the most recent month) predicts future returns. Often interpreted as a proxy for underreaction or investor herding.\n",
    "- **Skewness / Tail Risks**: Assets with negatively skewed returns (lottery-like) may be overpriced due to behavioral demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 Trading-Based Factors\n",
    "These reflect investor behavior and flow-driven dynamics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Short Interest**: High short interest or high borrow cost signals pessimism and often predicts underperformance.\n",
    "- **Active Ownership**: Stocks targeted by activists or insiders tend to outperform, especially if tied to governance or restructuring.\n",
    "- **Liquidity / Amihud Illiquidity**: Illiquid stocks earn higher returns, possibly compensating for trading costs and risk.\n",
    "- **Turnover / Share Issuance**: High share issuance and high turnover have been linked to lower future returns, possibly reflecting overpricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crowdedness matters: signals can lose predictive power when overused. Many trading-based factors capture frictions or flow-induced mispricing that decay with scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Note\n",
    "Even if a factor does not reliably predict *expected returns*, it may still explain *co-movement* across assets. That alone makes it essential for risk management and performance attribution. A robust understanding of both risk-based and behavioral interpretations helps in building resilient portfolios and separating true alpha from systematic exposure.\n",

    "\n",
    "Value investing is one of the most widely studied and implemented quantitative strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔎 What is it?\n",
    "A strategy that tilts the portfolio toward stocks that appear *cheap* relative to a fundamental anchor—and away from those that appear *expensive*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W_t \\propto \\frac{F_t}{P_t}\n",

    "Where \\( F_t \\) is a proxy for a firm’s fundamental value and \\( P_t \\) is its price.\n",

    "- Book Value\n",
    "- Earnings\n",
    "- Dividends\n",
    "- Cash Flows\n",
    "- Sales\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 📚 Academic Foundations\n",
    "- **[Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994) ](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/sites/valueinvesting/files/files/CIER.pdf)**: Behavioral view—investors overreact to past growth or bad news. Value stocks exploit these biases.\n",
    "- **[Fama and French (1996)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1996.tb05202.x)**: Rational risk-based view—value stocks are riskier, consistent with multifactor models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Why Might It Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Mispricing (Behavioral Story)**\n",
    "- Investors extrapolate trends or overreact to news.\n",
    "- Growth stocks become overpriced (“glamorous”); value stocks are neglected (“ugly”).\n",
    "- Contrarian rebalancing can capture mean-reversion in sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Risk (Rational Story)**\n",
    "- Value firms may be fundamentally riskier: more distress-prone, less flexible, or more sensitive to macro shocks.\n",
    "- This explains why value did poorly in crises like 2008 and 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Empirical Challenge to CAPM:**\n",
    "- In CAPM, higher expected return implies higher beta.\n",
    "- But as firms transition between value/growth portfolios, their beta doesn’t change accordingly.\n",
    "- This inconsistency suggests that beta alone can’t explain value spreads.\n",

    "## 📈 Return-Based Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Momentum** is the tendency for stocks that have performed **relatively well** in the recent past to continue performing well in the near future—and likewise for recent underperformers. This is a **cross-sectional** phenomenon: it’s about relative strength across stocks, not absolute performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic **momentum strategy** buys recent winners and shorts recent losers. Over the 1963–1990 period, Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) showed that a strategy ranking stocks by past 6-to-12-month returns and taking long/short positions in the top/bottom deciles delivered **abnormal returns of 12% per year**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚖️ Momentum vs. Value\n",
    "\n",
    "While **value** strategies buy beaten-down stocks based on fundamentals, **momentum** buys recent outperformers based on price trends. In fact, value and momentum often load on opposite ends of the performance spectrum:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Value stocks** have low recent returns (hence low prices vs. fundamentals)\n",
    "- **Momentum stocks** have high recent returns (regardless of valuation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ How to Construct a Momentum Portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "**Daniel and Moskowitz (2015)** provide a standard implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Rank stocks based on cumulative returns from **t–12 to t–2 months**, skipping the most recent month to avoid short-term reversal effects. Select stocks in the top and bottom deciles to form long and short portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "This 1-month skip is important to sidestep short-term noise and ensure the signal captures true momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Why Might It Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Behavioral Explanation**:\n",
    "- Investors are slow to fully process new information\n",
    "- News and sentiment get incorporated into prices gradually\n",
    "- Examples include political developments, earnings trends, or macro regime shifts (e.g., COVID, elections)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rational Explanation**:\n",
    "- Stocks with similar momentum may share exposure to unobserved risk factors\n",
    "- Momentum return could reflect compensation for time-varying risk exposures\n",
    "- However, it's hard to find a well-defined risk factor that explains the magnitude and persistence of the momentum premium\n",
    "\n",
    "Most academics lean toward behavioral explanations, though some admit rational risks may help explain co-movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Caveat**: Momentum **crashes hard in high-volatility environments**—notably in 2008 and 2020. So while profitable, it is **not low risk**.\n",
