    "# An overview of the main Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Factors come in many flavors. Academics look for factors that explain expected returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "- by removing know sources of risk-premia it only gives the strategy credit for what it is \"new\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Practitioners want factors that remove return variation that they are not interested in\n",
    "\n",
    "- removing variation in realized returns allow for better measurement of alpha \n",
    "- It also has the benefit of reducing risk\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We already have got exposed to a large variety of factors, but it is useful to zoom out and think about what these factors are capturing\n",
    "\n",
    "We can state these factors in terms of their characteristic or the associated factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I will state the characteristic--but there is always a factor associated characteristic\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I have the characteristic. The factor can be recovered with a cross-sectional regression as we saw in \"Multi-factor models\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The first set of factors are broad based features of the market\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The market the asset belong: us, germany, china, and so on. \n",
    "   - Any asset in this market has characteristic 1, 0 otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The sector of the stock\n",
    "   - any asset in the respective sector get a characteristic of 1, zero otherwise\n",
    "   - You can split firm from 5 up to 100s of industrial sectors\n",
    "- \n",
    "   If you are trading other assets, say corporate bonds, you can easily create similar factors in these cases\n",
    "\n",
    "The second group are factors that are popular in the academic community and have shown to predict returns. Their motivation typically comes from the idea that you can create a proxy for fundamentals or expected returns. They also happen to predict co-movement--imagine if they didn't...\n",
    "\n",
    "The first tries to do that using a combination of accounting and asset price data. I will call accounting-based characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "Accounting-based characteristics\n",
    "3. Book to market (also refereed as value): idea is that book might proxy for fundamental value, so the ratio of book to the market value is a measure of how high expected returns are. People might use a variety of other proxys for this fundamental value, but book is the most traditional.\n",
    "   - Other measures are Sales, Dividend, Earnings, ...\n",
    "   - Firms with high book to market have higher expected returns (they are cheap)\n",
    "4. Profitability/quality: The idea is that it proxys for firm quality. The actual measure is the ratio gross profitability to book assets, where gross profitability is profits minus cost of goods sold\n",
    "   - This works particularly well when combined with book-to-market. The issue with book to market is that it is possible  that the market price is low because fundamentals are expected to deteriorate. In fact that is exactly what standard finance theory would predict--market prices should incorporate market participants views about the future of the asset fundamentals! So maybe the stock is cheap because investors think the firm fundamentals are deteriorating\n",
    "   - So if you get all firms with similar Book-to-market and then sort them by profitability, the idea is that you separate the cheap high quality firms, from the correctly priced junk firms\n",
    "   - Firm with high profitabiity have higher expected returns specially if you control for book-to-market. \n",
    "   - There other quality proxys that people use which I discuss below\n",
    "5. Investment: The idea is that manager will invest more if they perceive discount rates to be low, so a firm that is conservative in their investments indicates that management see very high discount rates. The typical measure is CAPEX to assets\n",
    "   - The logic here is to use the decision making of CEO as a way to detect variation in expected returns\n",
    "   - More conservative firms in their investments earn higher expected returns\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns-based characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The beta of the asset with respect to the market factor. The classic one is univariate beta with respect to market portfolios, but this works across many factors. Typically you would think higher beta, higher expected returns, but this relationship flips specially if your model does not have many factors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. The total volatility of the asset. Similar to beta, as higher beta stocks are more volatile, but also captures idio volatility. The patterns in returns is most driven by very high volatile stocks--which means this is mostly about the indio piece--i.e. very high idio vol stocks tend to have low expected returns. \n",
    "   -   We will discuss \"beta\" and \"vol\" in detail below  as defensive investing\n",
    "8.  Short-term Reversal: The idea is that in the very high frequency (say monthly,weekly, daily), stocks that drop a lot in prices were likely heavily \"sold\", of course someone had to buy them, but the idea is that if they dropped in price is because some liquidity provider like citadel are absorbing the flow as increasingly lower prices. It works symmetrically for stocks that went up a lot. So low recent returns works as a signal of a high future expected return (in the very short horizon). Why? Because if the stock dropped a ton, it indicates that \"citadel\" is buying and therefore expected returns will be high goign forward\n",
    "   - Of course this does nto work in general for any price movement. But if you sort stocks in short term returns you end up caputring this\n",
    "   - If you had citadel actual positions, or conversely what non-market makers are selling, you would do even better as you would better separate information (price when down because bad information arrived) from price went down because Citadel demanded price concessions to absorb the retail flow\n",
    "   - So here the short-term losers (low returns) have high future returns, and the winners (high returns) have low returns\n",
    "9. Momentum: Not sure there is a simple consensus view here. One story is that the market does not fully incorporate  that fundamental news has momentum--good news about earnings, ends up translating in more future good news, so if you sort stocks on returns--now 12 month returns, while skipping 1 month to avoid the short-term reversal signal, then winners end up wining, and loosers lose.\n",
    "   - I know. Wild. But now high recent returns predict high future returns and low future return, predict low future returns\n",
    "   - It is not inconsistent with the short-term reversal trade because the look-back is very different\n",
    "\n",
    "Trading-based characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Shorting: The idea is to capture how much investors want to sell an asset short. The idea is that shorting is made mostly by sophisticated investors, and because shorting is very risky, if they are trying to short a lot is because they see the stock as over-valued, so they predict low returns going forward\n",
    "    - People use a few different measures to capture this.\n",
    "    - borrow rate: how much you have to pay to borrow a stock to short. High borrow rate means lots of people want to do it, but can't\n",
    "    - Amount of shorted stocks relative to market cap: measures how big are the shorting positions. sometimes people divide by the float, since for some stocks a big part of market cap is not traded (for example when they have a strong owner-founder)\n",
    "11. Active  holdings:  th idea is to look what activist portfolio managers are doing. If they buy a stock it must mean they think is undervalued. So in a sense is the opposite of the \"shorting\" play. \n",
    "   \n",
    "Both these trading-based charateristics can go both ways--maybe the traded can be too crowded. So it is also useful to see if your brillian idea is not already getting played by everyone else and it is already crowded. Finance theory would say: if these are the informed and these positions are risky, then they should be predictive and on average they are---but if everyone knows that and everyone is following them, and they don't really realize it, then it no longer works...so it is complicated\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While for all these characteristics with expected returns is unstable and sample dependent--there is no doubt that each of them captures a very important source of co-movement so are useful for risk-management and performance evaluation even if their use for direct asset allocation is less clear\n"

    "**Why this might work?**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Rational view: Maybe all these stocks are exposed to the same missing risk-factor. They all went up and down at the same time after all! For example all firms that went down in march 2020 are particularly exposed to Covid and the ones that did well are positively exposed. So they will move together as COVID risk fluctuate. It is hard to use a story like that to explain the premium, but it is easy to see how it explains the co-movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "* My overall sense is that the majority of academics think that momentum is driven by \"behavioral\" factors. Note however that momentum tends to crash very badly in high volatility periods such as 2008 and 2020, so it is certainly risky if you zoom out a bit.\n",
