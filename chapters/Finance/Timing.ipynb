    "# Factor Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "* So far we focused on strategies that overweight some assets and underweight others\n",
    "\n",
    "* While these strategies are dynamic--since the portfolios change every year or even every month\n",
    "\n",
    "* These strategies do not explicitly exploit the possibility that the risk and returns of the factors are time-varying\n",
    "\n",
    "* To the extent that they are, then you might benefit of dynamically change you exposure to the factor\n",
    "\n",
    "* Say for example, if, every thing else constant, you know that expected returns on the market next year is below the average, then you would reduce your position in it relative to what you typically have. You would move your money into cash or into other candidate asset\n",
    "\n",
    "* To keep it simple we always think of timing as moving money between on factor and cash\n",
    "\n",
    "* While one can time any factor, lets start with the most important one, the market\n",

    "**Market timing: Theoretical intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets consider the problem of this mean-variance investor that allocates between a risky asset (the market) and a risk-free asset. (For convenience the risky asset will already by an excess return, but that doesn't matter)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\max_{x_t} E_t[x_tr_{t+1} +(1-x_t)rf_{t+1}]-\\frac{\\gamma}{2}Var_t(x_tr^e_{t+1} +(1-x_t)rf_{t+1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The only difference from the previous mve analysis is that now it is only one risky asset, so this is particular case of that problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The other important difference is the `t` subscripts in the moments. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It means that the moments can be varying overtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this problem is super simple\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_t=\\frac{E_t[r_{t+1}-r^f_{t+1}]}{\\gamma Var_t(r_{t+1})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So you invest proportionally to the risk-return trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "- lever up if expected returns are higher\n",
    "\n",
    "- lever down if variance is higher\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice result is that you target the volatility of your portfolio to move up and down with the factor Sharpe ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_t\\sigma_t(r_{t+1})=\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\frac{E_t[r_{t+1}-r^f_{t+1}]}{ \\sigma_t(r_{t+1})}=SR_t(r_{t+1})$$\n",

    "If SR is up you choose to have a more volatile portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "- makes sense!it is more attractive to take risk! \n",
    "\n",
    "- The theory tells us that is all about the ratio of premium to variance\n",
    "\n",
    "- If risk-premiums goes up more than the variance, you lever up\n",

    "## Market Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "The most classic timing strategies are motivated by the fact that high dividend yield periods seems to be followed by above average returns\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot shows the dividend-yield of the stock market overlayed with the future 7 year returns \n",
    "![MVfrontier](../../assets/plots/Timing1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "It tell us that in this sample, periods when the dividend yield was high were periods where the returns were really high going forward\n",
    "\n",
    "This might be intuitive to you, but it is really a fact that puzzled lots of people and earned people a few Nobel Prizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It tells us that when the price (per dividend) is low what actually happens is NOT that the dividends go down going forward, but instead prices go up.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the EXPECTED returns to invest in the market change a lot overtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "A trading strategy that exploits this would have weights that depend on the dividend yield signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "for example you would have a weight \n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_t^{timing}=c(\\frac{d_t}{p_t})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "on the market excess return,so your strategy return is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_{t+1}^{timing}=(1-x_t^{timing})r_{f,t+1}+x_t^{timing}r_{t+1}^{mkt}$$\n",
