       "\"FedEx Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Transcript – March 20, 2025 \\n\\nJenifer Hollander \\nVice President-Investor Relations, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nGood afternoon, and welcome to FedEx Corporation's third quarter earnings conference call. The third quarter earnings \\nrelease, Form 10-Q and stat book are on our website at investors.fedex.com. This call and the accompanying slides are \\nbeing streamed from our website. \\n\\nDuring our Q&A session, callers will be limited to one question to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to \\nparticipate.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and \\nother factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking \\nstatements. For additional information on these factors, please refer to our press releases and filings with the SEC. \\n\\nToday's presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the Investor Relations portion of \\nour website at fedex.com for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the most \\ndirectly comparable GAAP measures. \\n\\nJoining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO; Brie Carere, Executive Vice President and Chief \\nCustomer Officer; and John Dietrich, Executive Vice President and CFO. \\n\\nNow, I will turn the call over to Raj. \\n\\nRajesh Subramaniam \\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nThank you, Jeni. I want to start by expressing my heartfelt gratitude to our team members. They delivered a strong peak \\nwithin a compressed time line and managed weather events ranging from unprecedented wildfires to severe winter \\nstorms. They accomplished this with a focus on safety and customer service. And I'm very appreciative of their dedication \\nand success. \\n\\nNow, turning to our Q3 results. Revenue was up 2%, growing on a year-over-year basis for the first time this fiscal year. \\nOur DRIVE savings continue to build sequentially, and we achieved $600 million of savings in the quarter. Taken together, \\nthese two factors enabled us to achieve 12% adjusted operating income growth compared to last year. \\n\\nAt Federal Express Corporation, we delivered strong year-over-year results, with adjusted operating income up 17% \\ndespite significant headwinds from the expiration of the United States Postal Service contract and severe weather events. \\nWeakness in the industrial economy continued to pressure our higher-margin B2B volumes. Similar to last quarter, this \\ndynamic was most pronounced at Freight, where fewer shipments and lower weights continue to negatively affect our \\nresults, albeit to a lesser extent than last quarter. Considering our B2B mix, we are well-positioned to capture strong \\nincremental flow-through when the industrial economy recovers. The current environment, however, is adding uncertainty \\nto demand. We continue to work closely with our customers to help them adapt to this evolving market. \\n\\nOur flexible and unmatched global network, digital tools and data ecosystem enable us to quickly support our customers' \\nneeds. With our vast data on cross-border trade, we are uniquely positioned to create more value for our customers as \\nthey navigate change. This includes providing a streamlined clearance experience for customers, while helping them \\ncomply with regulatory requirements. And through our automated processes, we can clear packages more quickly, better \\naddress improperly filed paperwork and reduce manual work to respond rapidly to our customers' needs, while improving \\nour operating efficiency. \\n\\nAs a reminder, in terms of our revenue split by geography, we serve an extremely diversified customer base across the \\nmore than 220 countries and territories. To put some numbers around this, taking our FY 2025 revenue through the third \\nquarter, nearly 75% comes from our US domestic services. Another approximately 10% of our revenue comes from non-\\n\\n1 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cUS intra-country or intra-regional services. And from a bilateral US trade perspective, our biggest single country exposure \\nrepresents only about 2.5% of total revenue. \\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, we remain focused on what we can control. First, Q3 DRIVE savings continue to ramp and were in \\nline with our expectations. We expect to achieve our incremental target of $2.2 billion for FY 2025 and our total of $4 \\nbillion of our FY 2023 baseline. \\n\\nSecond, we are creating a more flexible, efficient and intelligent network. As planned, we resumed Network 2.0 \\nconversions following peak. We have optimized five US stations since the beginning of the calendar year and expect to \\noptimize 45 more in Q4. We are on track to complete the rollout in Canada by the end of April. By the end of FY 2025, \\nabout 12% of our average daily global volume will flow through Network 2.0 optimized facilities. \\n\\nThird, Tricolor is driving better asset utilization as we improve aircraft density and better leverage our surface network. We \\nhave a broad range of KPIs that we are tracking to measure our progress. We're especially pleased that on a year-over-\\nyear basis, payloads across our air network are up 9%, with a 5% improvement in density. This is a key objective of our \\nTricolor operating model. Importantly, our progress is leading to positive flow-through on revenue growth from \\ninternational export freight. \\n\\nFourth, our plan to transition away from the U.S. Postal Service contract is going well, and we are continuing to remove \\ncosts associated with the expired contract. Fifth, our Freight separation work is underway. John will share more details \\nshortly. And lastly, we are providing our customers with the best value proposition in the industry. FedEx Ground and \\nFedEx Home Delivery are faster to more locations than UPS Ground. \\n\\nAs we look to the fourth quarter, in light of the uncertain demand environment, and higher than previously expected \\ninflationary pressures on our cost base, we are lowering our FY 2025 adjusted EPS outlook to $18 to $18.60. John will \\nprovide more color on the underlying assumptions. \\n\\nI'm excited about our transformation progress as we continue to integrate our networks, reduce our cost to serve and \\nenable better performance. Technology remains a key facilitator of our transformation. \\n\\nLast quarter, I shared details on the encouraging improvement we are seeing in Europe. That trend continued in Q3, with \\nour simplified technology platform driving both operational efficiency and a better experience for our customers. This is \\nalso leading to the best European service levels we have seen in years, which is driving profitable share growth. We \\nremain on track to achieve the $600 million in total DRIVE savings from Europe by the end of this fiscal year. \\n\\nIn support of our network transformation last month, we acquired RouteSmart Technologies, a global leader in route \\noptimization solutions. This acquisition allows us to bring in-house a dynamic route mapping solution with the best-in-class \\nalgorithm. Our legacy Ground business has used this technology with great success, and we are now rolling it out \\nglobally. This will be an important enabler of both Network 2.0 and our global network transformation, helping our team \\nmembers to work safer and smarter. \\n\\nIn closing, I'm proud of the team for their continued success. We navigated many headwinds in this third quarter, including \\na volatile demand environment, the Postal Service contract expiration, severe weather events and inflation. Yet, we still \\ndelivered 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and a 12% improvement in adjusted operating income. \\nLooking ahead, I'm confident that our transformation initiatives such as DRIVE, Network 2.0 and Tricolor will create long-\\nterm value for our stakeholders. \\n\\nNow, let me turn the call over to Brie. \\n\\n2 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cBrie A. Carere \\nChief Customer Officer & Executive Vice President, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nThank you, Raj. First, I also want to thank our team for a very successful peak. On Cyber Monday, we picked up nearly 24 \\nmillion packages in the United States. That's nearly 70% more than we pick up in the US on an average day. And given \\nthe compressed time line, we handled more packages per day year-over-year this peak season, while, of course, \\ncontinuing to deliver the Purple Promise for all our customers. \\n\\nWhile demand during peak exceeded our expectations, post-peak trends were largely consistent with the market \\nweakness of recent quarters. Consolidated revenue increased 2%, driven by higher volume in at Federal Express, \\npartially offset by Freight. The weak industrial economy continued to weigh on our global priority volumes in our LTL \\nbusiness. Against this backdrop, we continue to focus on profitable share growth. As we closed out calendar year 2024, \\nwe took profitable share in the US domestic and in international parcel, and also, because of our Tricolor strategy, we \\ngrew profitable global air freight share. \\n\\nLooking at each segment on a year-over-year basis, at Federal Express, revenue increased 3%, driven by increased \\nvolume in our deferred services. At Freight, lower volumes, fuel surcharges and weight per shipment pressured our top \\nline performance. This led to a 5% revenue decline. Overall volume trends improved in the quarter to our highest year-\\nover-year average daily volume growth since Q4 of fiscal year 2021, led by 5% growth in Federal Express package \\nvolumes. \\n\\nOur volume growth was driven by deferred services and the timing benefit of Cyber Week. And while LTL volumes were \\npressured, the rate of decline in average daily shipments improved compared to Q2. Across US domestic express \\nservices, volumes increased slightly, with growth in deferred services partially offset by a decline in priority volume. \\nGround volumes increased 7%, supported both by B2B and B2C growth. International export package volumes increased \\n8% in the quarter due to continued growth in the International Economy. With air freight, average daily pounds increased \\n3% for International Priority Freight. \\n\\nAs we shared last quarter, the growth here is tied directly to our Tricolor strategy to grow profitably in the global air freight \\nmarket. As expected, total US domestic express freight pounds declined significantly largely due to the Postal Service \\ncontract expiration. And at FedEx Freight, the soft industrial economy led to a 5% decline in average daily shipments and \\na 3% decline in weight per shipment. \\n\\nWe remain focused on quality growth amid a competitive but rational pricing environment. I am encouraged by recent \\npricing trends. Holiday demand surcharges supported our results and consistent with historical trends, we are seeing a \\nstrong capture rate on the 5.9% GRI implemented this past January. \\n\\nAt Federal Express, US domestic package yield was flat year-over-year as higher US express overnight package, Ground \\nCommercial, and Home Delivery yield was offset by lower Ground Economy yield. Similar to last quarter, and in line with \\nour expectation, international export package yield declined, driven by International Economy, partially offset by an 8% \\nyield increase for International Priority. \\n\\nAt FedEx Freight, revenue per shipment declined 1% due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and lower weight per shipment. \\nHowever, revenue per hundredweight increased 2%, a testament to our focus on revenue quality and the industry's \\ncontinued pricing discipline. \\n\\nAs we look ahead, we expect FY 2025 revenue to be flat to down slightly versus last year. For the fourth quarter, this \\nimplies essentially flat revenue at Federal Express driven primarily by continued volume growth in deferred service \\nofferings partially offset by one fewer operating day. At Freight, we expect a continued revenue decline on a year-over-\\nyear basis in Q4, but also expect the Q4 decline to moderate sequentially. \\n\\n3 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cLast quarter, I shared with you the framework for our commercial priorities: B2B growth, including healthcare and \\nautomotive, a focus on US domestic e-commerce, profitable growth in global air freight segment and of course, we want \\nto accelerate profitable growth in Europe. I am very pleased to report that we've had progress across all of our priorities.  \\n\\nA few highlights from the quarter. We continue to build unique capabilities for our high-margin healthcare vertical. For \\nexample, we are taking our established returns platform and using that technology for customers that require recurring \\ncollaborative shipments with their business partners or vendors. This has varied use cases across industries including lab \\nshipments between medical providers. This process enables a simpler shipping process with more visibility, allowing \\nshipment recipients to staff more appropriately and efficiently. \\n\\nDue to the hard work of our team and our compelling healthcare value proposition, we are onboarding nearly $400 million \\nin new annualized healthcare revenue over the next 90 days. Our advanced capabilities helped attract this new business \\nwith three-quarters of this business tied to bundled customers who are using the FedEx Surround suite. As a result of \\nthese wins, we will exit FY 2025 with approximately $9 billion in healthcare revenue. \\n\\nAdditionally, we further expanded FedEx Surround Monitoring and Intervention. And now, we offer this solution in over 40 \\ncountries. Surround's real-time, AI-powered dashboard gives customers enhanced visibility and control over their \\nshipments, which is especially helpful for customers transporting high-value or sensitive goods. \\n\\nWith 90% of the market's incremental parcel growth expected to come from e-commerce, we continue to refine how we \\nprofitably serve this market. Based on demand from our largest customers, we have expanded our Sunday residential \\ncoverage to nearly two-thirds of the US population, up from 50% previously. \\n\\nWe have already received incremental commitments of more than 0.5 million packages per week from existing customers \\ntied to our Sunday delivery capabilities. This change is enabling us to better utilize our existing assets without adding \\ncapacity while meeting the needs of our customers. As a result, we expect this incremental coverage to be profit accretive \\nin Q1 of fiscal year 2026. We will continue to lean in to these key strategies as we target profitable growth in the quarters \\nand years ahead. \\n\\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to John. \\n\\nJohn W. Dietrich \\nExecutive Vice President & CFO, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nThanks, Brie, and good afternoon. Our Q3 performance demonstrates our team's strong commercial execution and our \\nrigor in reducing structural cost through DRIVE. On a year-over-year basis, we grew adjusted operating profit in Q3 by \\nnearly $160 million or 12% despite headwinds from the Postal Service contract expiration, pressures at FedEx Freight, \\nand the severe weather events Raj mentioned. As a result, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 17%. \\n\\nNow, walking through the dynamics of the quarter, commercial execution at Federal Express focused on the key priorities \\nBrie mentioned and drove a $509 million increase in revenue, which resulted in strong flow-through to the bottom line. \\nDRIVE benefits of $600 million continue to reduce our structural costs and supported our earnings growth. \\n\\nWith respect to headwinds, Q3 was the first full quarter following the Postal Service contract expiration and as expected, \\nthis resulted in a $180 million headwind to adjusted operating income. This headwind will ease in Q4 as we continue to \\nreduce costs associated with the contract. \\n\\nWe also experienced severe weather headwinds of approximately $70 million relative to last year. And finally, the soft US \\nindustrial economy continued to weigh on B2B demand and FedEx Freight's weight per shipment. \\n\\n4 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNow, to providing more segment detail for Q3 on a year-over-year basis. At Federal Express, we grew adjusted operating \\nincome by $206 million, driven by DRIVE savings, base yield improvement, and increased US and international export \\ndemand. Our progress in Europe also contributed to adjusted operating income improvement in the quarter and I'm \\nconfident we'll continue this positive momentum in Q4 and FY 2026. \\n\\nAt FedEx Freight, operating profit declined $80 million year-over-year as lower fuel surcharges, and the soft US industrial \\neconomy continued to challenge the business. Base yield improvement as well as effective cost and head count \\nmanagement partially offset these headwinds at Freight. \\n\\nMoving to DRIVE, as we committed, we continued to sequentially improve our DRIVE savings, and we expect even \\nfurther savings in Q4. We delivered $600 million of savings in Q3 compared to $390 million in Q1 and $540 million in Q2. \\nAir and international savings of $245 million benefited the quarter as we continue to optimize commercial linehaul against \\naircraft capacity in our network. \\n\\nAdditionally, we optimized route productivity and pickup and delivery operations in our European network. We achieved \\nG&A savings of $220 million as we continue to rationalize vendor spend and increase back-office efficiency. And at \\nSurface, we achieved DRIVE savings of $135 million and all of these elements contributed to the total DRIVE savings of \\n$600 million in the quarter. \\n\\nTurning to our outlook, I'm encouraged by both our sequential earnings momentum and year-over-year growth. That said, \\ngiven the ongoing challenges in the global industrial economy, inflationary pressures, and the uncertainties surrounding \\nglobal trade policies, we now project FY 2025 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $18 to $18.60 compared \\nto our $19 to $20 prior range. \\n\\nFor Q4, we expect continued execution of our revenue quality strategy and further acceleration in DRIVE savings to \\nsupport sequential and year-over-year growth in adjusted operating income. We'll exit the fourth quarter by achieving our \\nFY 2025 goal at an annualized DRIVE run rate north of $2.2 billion. We expect headwinds from FedEx Freight to continue \\nin Q4 but forecast some moderation on a year-over-year basis. \\n\\nTurning now to our latest full year adjusted operating income bridge, this shows the year-over-year operating profit \\nelements embedded in our revised outlook. This bridge now reflects adjusted operating profit of $6.2 billion, equivalent to \\n$18.30 of adjusted EPS. For revenue net of costs, we now expect a $1.1 billion headwind, which is $400 million above our \\nprior forecast. This is a result of revised second half assumptions for revenue and inflation. \\n\\nWe now project a $400 million headwind from international export yield pressure. The $100 million increase is a result of \\nbase yield pressure, particularly in International Economy and greater than previously expected demand for our lower-\\nyielding deferred service offerings. We still expect a $300 million headwind from two fewer operating days in Q1 and Q4. \\n\\nAnd lastly, we now anticipate a $400 million impact from the expiration of the U.S. Postal Service contract, which is an \\nimprovement of $100 million from our prior guidance due to our ability to swiftly eliminate contract-related costs. As I \\nmentioned, we also expect to see our $2.2 billion in expected DRIVE savings for FY 2025, which is offsetting these \\nheadwinds. \\n\\nAt the midpoint of our revised FY 2025 outlook, we're now assuming 3% adjusted EPS growth on flat to slightly down \\nrevenue year-over-year. Overall, our revenue in Q3 and expectation for Q4 are softer than previously anticipated, with \\nweakness coming primarily from B2B and priority services. This further pressures our bottom line. In addition, inflationary \\npressures on our cost base are expected to be higher than planned, further reducing our full year outlook. \\n\\nMoving to capital allocation, we continued to significantly reduce capital intensity while returning capital to shareholders. \\nWe completed approximately $500 million in share repurchases in Q3, bringing the year-to-date number to $2.5 billion, \\nour target for the full year. And including our dividend, we're on track to return $3.8 billion to shareholders in FY 2025. In \\n\\n5 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cQ3, capital expenditures were $997 million, and our planned FY 2025 CapEx is now down to $4.9 billion, a $300 million \\ndecline compared to last year's $5.2 billion, supporting strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. \\n\\nFrom a fleet standpoint, we recently reached agreements to purchase eight new Boeing 777 freighter aircraft and two \\nused 777 freighters, which will be phased-in during calendar years 2026 and 2027. These modern and fuel-efficient \\naircraft were purchased at attractive prices and will help us manage our fleet for the long-term while still upholding our FY \\n2026 commitment to approximately $1 billion of aircraft CapEx. \\n\\nGiven that these new planes are highly efficient, and we’ll retire our older, more maintenance-intensive fleet over time, I'm \\nconfident that aircraft CapEx in the immediate years beyond FY 2026 will remain in the area of $1 billion. We've continued \\nto manage and rationalize the size of our jet fleet, including retiring some of our older aircraft over the last several years. \\nThis is consistent with our go-forward strategy to prioritize revenue quality and grow in the premium segments of the \\nmarket. \\n\\nWe've retired 20 MD-11s over the past three years and now expect to retire the remainder of the MD-11 fleet by the end \\nof FY 2032 versus our prior FY 2028 target. This extension of some of these aircraft will help us ensure network flexibility \\nwhile minimizing aircraft CapEx. \\n\\nIn December, we shared our plans to fully separate FedEx Freight. Since our December announcement, we set up a \\nSeparation Management Office and established a cross-functional team to ensure a smooth transition. And we're making \\nprogress on all fronts. In anticipation of the separation, last month, we completed a very successful $16 billion debt \\nexchange offer and consent solicitation. This will create more flexibility for both companies' capital structures as we \\nprepare for the separation, which will come in the form of a tax-efficient spin-off. \\n\\nAs our Separation Management Office continues to advance our spin-related work, it's business as usual for our other \\nteam members and all our customers. At Freight, this includes the same unwavering focus on safety and disciplined \\napproach on revenue quality, network utilization, and operational efficiency that has driven the business' success in recent \\nyears. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I remain confident in our long-term ability to continue increasing shareholder returns, and I'm committed to \\nensuring that we unlock the value that I know is embedded in our business. \\n\\nAnd with that, let's open it up for questions. \\n\\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION \\n\\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Jonathan Chappell with \\nEvercore ISI. Please go ahead. \\n\\nJonathan Chappell \\nAnalyst, Evercore Group LLC \\n\\nThank you. Good afternoon. John, part of the reasons for the guidance cut, I think, are pretty clear, B2B weakness, \\nuncertainty, et cetera. The higher inflation element of the cost side seems to be pretty new. Is there any way to quantify \\nexactly how much that's impacting the guide change, kind of how sticky that is and what that may mean for margins going \\nforward? \\n\\n6 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cJohn W. Dietrich \\nExecutive Vice President & CFO, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nSo, Jonathan, hello. With regard to inflation, I think it's been consistent. It's just when we look at some of the factors that \\naren't going to go away when you look at PT, for example, as we increase our volumes particularly during peak, for \\nexample, inflation has been a constant. \\n\\nAnd also, with regard to our wages for our employee group, it's just something that we're going to continue to keep our \\neye on. We're going to continue to try and contain that, but it's been a constant throughout this, and it's been a factor that \\nhas been one of the several that you flagged as part of our guidance. \\n\\nOperator: The next question is from Richa Harnain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \\n\\nRicha Harain \\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank \\n\\nHey, everyone. Thanks for welcoming me on to this call for the first time. So, I was hoping we could learn a little bit more \\nabout FedEx's exposure maybe to de minimis shipments. It might have likely changed with the tax code on such \\nshipments. Maybe you could help us better understand your exposure there. How much of FedEx shipment volumes is \\ntied to de minimis and how is the team preparing for this change? And if that's sort of how that works into your calculus \\naround flat revenue for Q4 and I guess going forward. \\n\\nBrie A. Carere \\nChief Customer Officer & Executive Vice President, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nHi, Richa. Welcome to the call. From a de minimis perspective, I think the most important thing to note is that we are very \\nready from an operational capability perspective. Our clearance teams around the world have made the necessary \\nchanges. We are working with customers. Obviously, this is probably the largest impact would be customers coming out \\nof the Asia market and so from an operational perspective, we feel very ready to execute the necessary change. \\n\\nIn addition to that, I think it's really important to remember that we have insight around the world into clearance data and \\nso we're working very closely with our customers to be able to prepare themselves for any change, whether it's de minimis \\nor a change in market due to tariff. And so, working very closely with this. \\n\\nFrom a Q4 perspective and an outlook on revenue and volume, our focus really is that the majority of the volumes in the \\nback half of this year will look a lot like Q3. There's a couple of exceptions that I want to note is that we look at those \\nvolume trends. December, obviously, was a very strong month for us. So, really January through May look similar. \\n\\nIn Q4, as we head into Q4 and we think about revenue and volume outlook, it's also important to remember that Q4 has \\none less operating day year-over-year. And so, that's really how I'm thinking about the back half of the year, but from a de \\nminimis perspective, we're ready to help our customers through any change. \\n\\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \\n\\nScott H. Group \\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research LLC \\n\\nHey, thanks. Afternoon. So, John, I know it's a bit early, but wondering if you want to share any thoughts on some of the \\nputs and takes to think about for fiscal 2026 and some of the company-specific stuff in terms of, I don't know, DRIVE, \\nNetwork 2.0, anything like that. And then on the LTL side, can you just give us an update on how we're trending relative to \\n\\n7 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cthat 18-month timeline? And any additional commentary, Brie, you want to make on – your comments last quarter about \\nplaying offense, I think, spooked people a little bit and just anything you want to add there. Thank you, guys. \\n\\nJohn W. Dietrich \\nExecutive Vice President & CFO, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nHey, Scott. Thanks for those three questions. So, look, for 2026, I'm not going to be providing outlook. We'll be providing \\nthat to you in June. What I can say is that we're going to be focused on profitable growth. I think it's reasonable to assume \\nthat the macro environment is not going to significantly improve at least for the first half of FY 2026. \\n\\nBut some other high-level points to help frame our thinking for the year, we'll enjoy the annualization of benefits from our \\ncurrent DRIVE initiatives, which will amount to about $400 million of benefit. Of course, and as Raj has talked about, \\nDRIVE is a way of life for us. We're going to keep feeding that pipeline for further savings and pull those levers at every \\nchance. \\n\\nWe're also going to be continuing to advance Network 2.0, Tricolor in our Europe initiatives, all that we're excited about, \\nbut we do expect inflationary cost pressures to continue. I can say that, and we'll also have some headwinds with regard \\nto the Postal Service for four of the months of FY 2026, namely the three months in Q1 and one month in Q2. \\n\\nNow, I talked about Network 2.0 savings, and we will benefit in FY 2026, but I want to be clear that we expect these \\nsavings to have a heavier ramp in FY 2027, resulting in a significant majority of those savings occurring in FY 2027. So, \\nwe're going to continue to focus in FY 2026 on those things within our control. So, that's question number one. \\n\\nQuestion number two, with regard to the LTL timeline, yeah, we're on track. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we \\nhave set up a separation office. We have project plans in place, and we're on track to meet the timelines that we \\ndiscussed when we announced the separation. \\n\\nAnd then finally, I know your comment on offense, and I think that was taken really out of context. Our focus is going to be \\non – for freight quality revenue and the comment was just we're going to bolster our sales staffing that are going to have \\nsubject matter expertise in this specific LTL space. So, we expect the pricing environment to remain rational, and that's \\nour focus. We want to maximize revenue quality, not diminish it. So, hopefully, that covered all three. \\n\\nRajesh Subramaniam \\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nYeah. Let me – that's terrific and let me just add a point here. And Scott, thanks for the question. \\n\\nI think when we look at what we have accomplished over the last couple of years, we have fundamentally changed our \\nstructural cost and that puts us in good territory. And when you look at the top and bottom-line performance versus our \\ncompetition, we have really done a lot better. So, that just sets the stage for FY 2026. \\n\\nAt the same time, we have several transformational network projects, whether it is Tricolor, Network 2.0, taking down the \\ndaytime network that supported the post office, that really increases our flexibility. At the same time, we also now have \\ntechnology that's supporting all this to make sure that we are more optimized. \\n\\nWhat this is doing now is allowing us to expand the market that we can now grow profitably in. So, while, yes, there is a – \\nwe don't know exactly how the business environment, especially the industrial environment, is going to play out. You \\nwould assume that one of these days, it will turn back into the positive, that we now have opportunity to grow in the \\nsegments of the market profitably because of the work we have done on our cost structure as well as our network \\ntransformation. So, it's a broader point. So, we are looking whether it's business or residential, whether it's US or global, \\nparcel or pallet, fast or slow, big or small, we now have value proposition that allows us to grow profit. Thank you. \\n\\n8 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOperator: The next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. \\n\\nBascome Majors \\nAnalyst, Susquehanna \\n\\nThanks for taking my question. Can you talk about where you are in the build-out of the dedicated sales force? I think you \\nsaid 300 with the December update and just some early thoughts on what those incentives looks like and the outcomes \\nyou want to drive from that team? Thank you. \\n\\nBrie A. Carere \\nChief Customer Officer & Executive Vice President, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nSure. Thanks, Bascome. And to Scott, to your point, I know what words I won't use on future calls, but to John and Raj's \\npoint, we do want to continue to focus on profitable growth. And that is going to be the focus of the dedicated sales team. \\nTo John's point, really that is the focus there, is that we're becoming a very large organization. As you've just heard from \\nRaj, we have multiple growth strategies that we need to execute, and we're particularly excited about those. \\n\\nThis team then allows us to go deep and have deep expertise in the LTL. We also think this coverage will allow us to \\ncontinue to take share in the small and medium customer segment. We already do a very good job there, but we see that \\nas upside opportunity as we get better coverage for small customers with a focused team. The officer, the vice president, \\nis in place. I think I mentioned that on last call. He's doing a great job of bringing some hiring on. We want to hire the right \\nexpertise that can appropriately represent the brand, that can appropriately execute our revenue quality strategy. So, it \\nwill take several months. We're in good shape right now, but this hiring will continue throughout next fiscal year. \\n\\nOperator: The next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead. \\n\\nDavid Vernon \\nAnalyst, Bernstein \\n\\nHey. Good afternoon, guys. So, with the Network 2.0 project and the 200 facilities that you guys have run, appreciate the \\ndata point on 12% of the average daily volume now running through an integrated facility. Can you help us kind of think \\nabout what the productivity benefits you're getting out of that sample size, some of the challenges you're seeing or maybe \\nareas for further kind of refinement as you're working on rolling out the broader Network 2.0 initiatives? Thanks. \\n\\nRajesh Subramaniam \\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nYeah. Thank you, David. Firstly, we are pleased with how this Network 2.0 rollout is going on and is doing at a thoughtful \\nand a calculated pace. As said, we have integrated under the Network 2.0 model. We have maintained solid service levels \\nwhile still achieving our goal of 10% reduction on our P&D costs. \\n\\nBy the end of fiscal 2025, as we talked about, 12% of the total volume flowing through Network 2.0 will be flowing through \\nthese Network 2.0 facilities. And by the end of FY 2026, we expect that number to be about 40%. \\n\\nAnd also, Network 2.0 represents a significant reduction in our surplus capacity over the years to come. So, yes, we are \\nquite pleased with how this is going. We have a terrific team that for every rollout, we take the learnings and apply it to the \\nnext one and the next one and so on, so we get better going forward. The team has done a really remarkable job, and I \\nthink more to come as we – in FY 2026. Thank you. \\n\\n9 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOperator: The next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \\n\\nJordan Alliger \\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC \\n\\nYeah. Hi. I know the LTL margins have been under pressure with the industrial economy. I'm just sort of curious. Once \\nthings start to get better there, can you maybe talk to where do you want to see or where do you think what should LTL \\nmargins look like sort of more in the medium and long-term? Do we get back to the levels we saw prior to a few quarters \\nago? Thanks. \\n\\nJohn W. Dietrich \\nExecutive Vice President & CFO, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nYeah. Thanks, Jordan. Look, we have tremendous confidence in our LTL business and what's been built there. It's \\nimportant to remember that a large percentage, roughly 90% of the LTL revenue, is linked to B2B and as we've talked \\nabout at length, the B2B business and industrial production has been softer. And that's put pressure on the industry, \\nfrankly. \\n\\nSo, we're confident in our ability and are well-positioned once the B2B business rebounds. But in the meantime, as Brie \\ntalked about, we're focusing on constant improvement, customer service coverage, our sales team. So, yeah, we're highly \\nconfident in expanding the margins for sure. \\n\\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \\n\\nChris Wetherbee \\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo \\n\\nMaybe I could pick up on that comment around Freight margins and maybe get a sense of what you need to see to start \\nto begin to stabilize them and maybe move them forward. Seems like pricing – underlying pricing environment remain \\nquite good. I get the volume is down. Fuel is down. But I guess the pricing as good as it is, is it something as we turn the \\nquarter into ‘26 you start to see some pertinent expansion again in that business or what are the levers you need to pull to \\nstart to see that come back? \\n\\nBrie A. Carere \\nChief Customer Officer & Executive Vice President, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nHi, Chris. I'll start and then turn it over to John if he has any additional color. I think to John's point is that right now, we are \\nbeing very prudent in our growth strategy as we see the market come back from a B2B demand perspective. We are very \\nwell-positioned to capture that growth, the flow-through and the team's ability to capture incremental profit on that volume, \\nwe feel very confident. \\n\\nWe do anticipate from a margin perspective that Q4 will be strong for us. We will see sequential improvement in revenue \\nat the Freight division. It will still be down year-over-year from a revenue perspective, but I'm anticipating quite a good \\nmargin in Q4 and that will then be similar in FY 2026. \\n\\n10 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cJohn W. Dietrich \\nExecutive Vice President & CFO, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nAnd I'll just add, we sell a service and continuing to focus on service will allow us to capture more business. And that's all \\ngoing to be part of the more volume we get, focusing on the density and weight per shipment. So, all those things taken \\ntogether, we think, will operate favorably for LTL. \\n\\nOperator: The next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead. \\n\\nBrandon R. Oglenski \\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. \\n\\nHi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Brie, I appreciate the commentary on volumes through the fourth \\nquarter. I think that's very helpful, but US investors are increasingly worried about a recession here just given all the \\nuncertainty around policies, especially trade and tariffs. So, can you give us maybe more qualitative inputs on what your \\ncustomers are seeing right now and how they're reacting to this environment? And how future tariff impositions could \\nimpact your business? Thank you. \\n\\nBrie A. Carere \\nChief Customer Officer & Executive Vice President, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nThanks for the question, Brandon. From an outlook perspective, we think that we have given you a very prudent forecast \\nfor the fourth quarter and that this incorporates the feedback that we've had from our customers around the world. I would \\nsay that from a feedback perspective, I think, first, the number one thing that we keep getting asked is has there been a \\npull forward. We did not see any significant pull forward in Q3. \\n\\nWe did see a little volatility in APAC kind of at the end of February, early March. But for the most part, a pull forward is \\nreally hard. So, we have not seen that. Actually, in all the sales calls that I've done over the last 90 days, I've actually only \\nmet one customer who attempted it, and they regretted it because they ended up storing some excess inventory. \\n\\nAs far as kind of how customers are planning, we're having a lot of conversation about being able to move the network as \\nthey require and of course, we are able to do that. We are looking at making sure all of our pricing tools are very dynamic. \\nWe've been very pleased with that. So, from our ability to respond to customers, most customers have not made any \\nmajor changes to date because it's really quite difficult to be able to set up additional inventory in another country or move \\nmanufacturing. These are things that happen over months and years, not over weeks. \\n\\nI would say to the point on inflation that we are talking to a lot of customers who are anticipating that they will increase \\nprices or already have. So, thematically, that is one conversation that we've heard a lot from. \\n\\nI don't know, Raj, John, if you want to add anything. \\n\\nRajesh Subramaniam \\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nWell, let me just jump in as well. I think in a broader perspective, we'll see how the short-term demand environment plays \\nout here, but from – think about the network that FedEx has built. We connect 220 countries and territories, one to the \\nother and as the supply chain patterns change, the good news is scale is going to help us because we are already in all \\nthese markets. I was just in our LAC headquarters this week, and they reported to me that many countries in the region \\nare seeing more inbound into those markets. We don't have to do a thing different because the network is already in \\nplace, and we are – that volume is coming through the network. \\n\\n11 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cThe second thing is and as Brie has already covered on the operational side, we are basically ready to make that happen \\nfor our customers, but here's another important point. Think about all the data that's required for one country to every \\nother country for every commodity. Well, we have that data, and we have from an operational perspective, but most \\nimportantly, we have organized that data and structured that data over the last five years. \\n\\nSo, now, in these more complicated times, we now have an ability to provide new value for our customers, leveraging the \\ninsights that we have on what global supply chains and customs clearance. So, again, that also becomes an enabler but \\nalso a differentiator and a value creator in its own right. So, this is a very dynamic environment as we speak. \\n\\nOperator: The next question is from Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Please go ahead. \\n\\nDaniel Imbro \\nAnalyst, Stephens, Inc. \\n\\nYeah. Hi. Good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking our questions. Brie, maybe on the Federal Express side, you \\nmentioned the pricing backdrop was stable. I think peak surcharges helped the quarter. But how has that progressed here \\ninto fiscal 4Q? The industry seems to be remaining rational, but obviously, you mentioned trade down. I guess how should \\nwe think about or net those two things against each other as we think about the pace of pricing moving through the end of \\nthis year and into fiscal 2026? \\n\\nBrie A. Carere \\nChief Customer Officer & Executive Vice President, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nThanks for the question, Daniel. So, I think a couple of things. First, from a market and a pricing environment perspective, \\nit's always competitive, but it's been rational. And honestly, I think if anything, we've seen improvement in the environment \\nthroughout the fiscal year. I was really pleased with our demand surcharge capture in December. I've also been very \\npleased out of the gate with our GRI capture, which was 5.9%. So, from a pricing perspective, I feel pretty good. \\n\\nYou said something about trade down. I really want to correct that a bit. When we looked at, first of all, all of our yields, \\nand I think it's really important to look at this, when you look at the individual products, I'm quite pleased with the yield \\ngrowth overall. Domestic priority yield is up, IP yield is up. \\n\\nWhen you look at the Ground segment, both Ground Commercial, as well as Ground Home Delivery, are up. What we are \\nsimply seeing is that the demand for deferred volume is outpacing the growth for priority. In addition to that, the team has \\ndone an outstanding job of capturing that deferred growth both internationally as well as domestically. I think the best \\nproof point that I can give you is the 17% improvement in margin in the quarter at FEC that really does show that not only \\ndid we capture deferred domestically, we captured it internationally. \\n\\nSo, we're doing a job of managing each product. And then when there is a deferred demand, it's important that we capture \\nit in the right product because as we optimize our network and implement our transformation, whether it's Network 2.0, \\nwhether it's Europe, whether it's Tricolor, we are building the right cost structure with the right transit for those deferred \\nproducts. So, it's not been a shift. It really is just about the deferred growth growing faster. \\n\\nRajesh Subramaniam \\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nAnd I want to jump on the last point that Brie just talked about. It also connects to what I said earlier on our networks. So, \\nas we have engineering our networks, not by the legacy opcos, but now across the whole enterprise, we have now unique \\ncombinations of fly truck fly, truck fly truck, so many different pieces, aided by latest technology. And this – we are able to \\nnow profitably grow in these deferred markets as well. And that's a big difference because now we are getting to a cost \\n\\n12 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cstructure to profitably serve this increasing swaths of demand. By the way, as we roll our Network 2.0, as we – as Europe \\ngets better, as we roll out Tricolor, these things just get better as we move forward. \\n\\nOperator: The next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead. \\n\\nThomas Wadewitz \\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC \\n\\nYeah. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask you a little bit more, I think you're talking about it a bit, just on the deferred \\nvolumes in Ground. You saw a pretty significant lift in, I guess, Ground residential, right? And I'm wondering if you like \\nhave a sense of where that's coming from. Is that a function of the SurePost changes at UPS or something else? And I \\nguess, broadly on Parcel Select, as Postal Service really changes that dynamic, is that a meaningful impact? Is that \\npositive to pricing in a significant way? And then I guess, one last piece, just any thoughts on LTL leadership, external or \\ninternal. Sorry, I know there's a couple in there. Thank you. \\n\\nBrie A. Carere \\nChief Customer Officer & Executive Vice President, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nOkay. I'll take the first two, and I'll let my boss take the third one. From a deferred growth, from a Ground portfolio in the \\npast quarter and actually throughout the year, our FedEx Ground Economy product has been driving that residential \\ngrowth. Actually, it's been a really good news story for FedEx. First of all, our Ground Economy product is incredibly \\ncompetitive. The team does a really good job from a transit perspective. Every single Ground Economy package also has \\npicture proof of delivery, which we've just had a tremendous response from. \\n\\nAnd of course, the product also has some of the weekend advantage, not all of the weekend advantage that Home \\nDelivery does, but some of the weekend advantage. So, it's a very competitive product. What we have seen as we have \\ntaken share through FedEx Ground Economy this year is, first of all, we're really pleased with the yields that we're getting \\nwith that. In addition to and what I'm so proud of the sales team is if you look at the incremental volume that we have \\ntaken on this year, every FedEx Ground package comes with two other packages domestically, and the revenue is $1 to \\n$4. So, for every $1 we bring in from a FedEx Ground Economy, we're getting $4 of domestic revenue. \\n\\nWe're really pleased with that. That is very specific to the new customers we've acquired this year, but we're really \\npleased with that. And then again, I think we're capturing it. Is it because of some of the changes in the market? That \\ncertainly has helped. But honestly, I think it's about our value proposition being the strongest in the market. \\n\\nRajesh Subramaniam \\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nAnd Tom, to your last question there, we are conducting a very comprehensive search for the CEO of FedEx Freight, and \\nI'm confident that through our thorough process that we will provide FedEx Freight with the right visionary leader who can \\nhelp chart the cores of this new stand-alone own company. And we'll look forward to updating you on that decision, as \\nwell as the broader leadership team in the near future. \\n\\nOperator: The next question is from Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please go ahead. \\n\\nJason H. Seidl \\nAnalyst, TD Securities (USA) LLC \\n\\nThank you, operator, and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to jump back on the Freight side here. You \\nmentioned that your expectations are for the shipments to decline as they get a little less worse. I was wondering, is that \\ndue to some maybe shifts in the weather pushing some freight from quarter-to-quarter? Or do you think things might be \\n\\n13 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cgetting just a little bit better on the LTL side? And then, if I could just throw one other one in there, any thoughts on some \\nof the proposed changes at the USPS on the cost side? \\n\\nJohn W. Dietrich \\nExecutive Vice President & CFO, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nSo, Jason, I'll start with the LTL. I think it's all the factors we talked about is why we have confidence in our LTL business, \\nthe expanded sales force, the improved service, the back-office focus. And it's I think an important note to mention even \\nthough we've set up the Separation Management Office, that office is charged with really two work streams. One, continue \\nto improve the business today, as well as prepare for the future separation tomorrow. So, all those reasons factor into why \\nwe have confidence in that growth. \\n\\nBrie A. Carere \\nChief Customer Officer & Executive Vice President, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nThanks, John. I think the second half of the question was about some of the competitive changes that USPS has made in \\nthe market. I think the first and most important thing is, of course, we are very focused on customers that appreciate our \\nvalue proposition, the quality service, the reliability that we provide. FedEx Ground Economy, as we mentioned early, are \\nvery well positioned compared to the USPS's Ground Advantage product. We are being selective, but I will say that some \\nof the pricing and, honestly, some of the service challenges in the market from our competitors are helping us from an \\nacquisition perspective, certainly. \\n\\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \\n\\nBrian P. Ossenbeck \\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC \\n\\nHey. Thanks for taking the question. So quick follow-up for Brie. Can you just talk about the ability to keep pushing price in \\nthis sort of environment? We're seeing surcharges increase, core price obviously increased. You mentioned the trade \\ndown, certainly deferred product growth, but I would imagine that some of that is coming from people making that \\ndecision. And then if you can maybe just touch on Europe. We haven't had a lot of positivity around that space in a little \\nwhile, but it sounds like you're actually seeing some momentum. So, I want to hear about how that was progressing and if \\nwe should start to see a little bit more acceleration as that economy starts to pick up a little bit of pace at least on a \\nrelative basis. Thank you. \\n\\nBrie A. Carere \\nChief Customer Officer & Executive Vice President, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nSure. Let me start with the second part. I've got a lot of positivity for Europe. When I look at the ability to grow, and I think \\nwe've mentioned it before, the European division, when we look at their parcel market share, has taken share now seven \\nquarters in a row. So, from a momentum perspective, I am really pleased, and, of course, the economy in Europe is not \\nhelping that team, and it's much more difficult to take profitable market share in a down economy, but that's exactly what \\nthe team is doing. How are they doing it? Service has been sequentially better quarter-after-quarter. Huge shout out to \\nWouter and the team over in Europe. Productivity is also improving. And so, we're seeing great flow-through, which allows \\nthat flywheel to continue. \\n\\nSo, from a Europe perspective, we do have upside opportunities still, some work we have to do in that region. There's no \\ndoubt about it, but we are really pleased with the fiscal year that team is having. And I should also say they've done a \\ngreat job on intercontinental out of Europe, as well as across Europe. \\n\\n14 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cAnd then from a deferred perspective, to your point, yes, there has been some trade down. But again, the majority of the \\ndeferred parcel volume that we are seeing is incremental customer. That's new customer acquisition, which we're really \\npleased with. From a pricing perspective, as I mentioned, when we look at our discipline, we continue to be the market \\nleader. So, I look at each one of those products and how we're moving them forward. \\n\\nAs I just talked about, when you look at the premium segment, we're making sure we're not discounting the premium \\nparcels to capture share. You can see that, that we are getting yield improvement. We're being very disciplined on \\nsurcharges. I talk about that a lot because it's really important. We do the best job in the market on large package. We are \\nthe only – versus our primary competitor, we go to all of the rural markets in the country. And so those are helping get a \\ndisproportionate margin on some of those harder to handle packages. So, surcharges are really important. And I do think \\nthat we are going to start to see as we move into FY 2026 some lapping of some of the pressure that we have seen on \\nbase. It won't be all the way through in the front half of FY 2026, just given the length of our contracts, but we are certainly \\nseeing improvement in the pricing market. \\n\\nOperator: The next question is from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please go ahead. \\n\\nConor Cunningham \\nAnalyst, Melius Research \\n\\nHi, everyone. Thank you. I'm a little confused on the changes to the air fleet side. With the incremental Boeing 777s, I \\nwould have thought that would have resulted in maybe a retirement of MD-11, but you actually extended up. So, can you \\njust give some color on what's going on with the fleet strategy? And maybe it's just as simple as you have a bunch of \\nplanes that are parked and – or maybe you could just talk about that relative to where you were last year and where you \\nare now, that would be helpful. Thank you. \\n\\nJohn W. Dietrich \\nExecutive Vice President & CFO, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nSure. Thanks, Conor. And let me just take a moment to reiterate our commitment to stay on track to what we put out there \\nfor FY 2026 on the $1 billion aircraft CapEx target. As I stated in my prepared remarks, we're planning to stay within that \\narea of investment not only in FY 2026, but for the immediate years beyond, and these aircraft acquisitions are within that \\nframework. \\n\\nThat all said, our investments are focused on return on invested capital, which is now also included in our executives' \\nlong-term incentive compensation. So, giving that to you by a way of a little bit of background, I did a little homework. I \\nhaven't been here all that long, but I did some homework on the last Boeing 777 orders, and they were all the way back in \\n2018. \\n\\nSo, it's been a while since we ordered new airplanes. And these airplanes are particularly attractive. In fact, I'd say they're \\ncoveted assets because they're the last – the eight new ones. I'm not talking about the two used ones. With the eight new \\nones, they're the last of the current model of the Boeing 777 freighter to be produced by Boeing, and we acquired them at \\nvery attractive prices. \\n\\nAnd I note that because those of you who know me from my prior company know that I also acquired the last four Boeing \\n747s that were ever produced that turned out to be one of the best financial acquisitions for that company. These aircraft \\nare in very high demand, and we didn't want to let them go, for one. But our decision was really informed by both our MD-\\n11 retirement plans, as well as our growth projections for the international freight market. I think it's important to \\nremember, not only has it been a while since we ordered Boeing 777s, but we permanently removed 31 aircraft at the end \\nof FY 2024, which were nine MD-11 and 22 Boeing 757s. So, it's a combination of incremental versus replacement \\ncapacity. \\n\\n15 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cWith regard to the MD-11s and the kind of push to the right of those retirements, that was done for business reasons. Due \\nto our international economy growth, we've made the decision to extend those to FY 2032. Those assets are mostly \\ndepreciated, but have some useful life left in them and can support our profitable growth strategy. So, if the demand \\nenvironment doesn't pan out, we also have the ability to accelerate any retirements on MD-11s. \\n\\nBut right now, given the demand that we're seeing out there, particularly in the international economy growth, we elected \\nto extend the life of those aircraft. So, it's a combination of all those factors. So hopefully, that was helpful. \\n\\nOperator: The next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \\n\\nRavi Shanker \\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley \\n\\nHey, thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups here. Just on de minimis, what percentage of your revenues comes from \\ncustomers who typically use a de minimis rule for shipping their products? And second, on Europe, you mentioned \\nprofitable growth there. Can you confirm if Europe is profitable or not? And if not, kind of when do you think it might get \\nthere once you guys put in all DRIVE and other initiatives? Thank you. \\n\\nRajesh Subramaniam \\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nWell, I'll just say, Ravi, that the majority of our export volumes are linked to B2B volumes and a minority of our revenue \\nbase on export lanes are covered under the de minimis exemption. And of course, we are just pleased with the progress \\nwe're making in Europe, the $600 million of DRIVE savings are in FY – this fiscal year, and we expect to see more of that \\nin the next year. \\n\\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead. \\n\\nKen Hoexter \\nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc. \\n\\nHey. Good afternoon. Just to clarify Dave Vernon's question earlier on Network 2.0. As you accelerate on a number of \\nmarkets, is there any initial volume loss or added costs such as software rollout that needs to be done or do you need to \\nslow down ops just to check out how things are progressing? \\n\\nAnd then Brie, thanks for the thoughts on the shift to economy. Can you talk about how you adjust the cost structure to \\nmeet the significantly lower yield on those products? \\n\\nRajesh Subramaniam \\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nOn Network 2.0, so far, so good. And so we are, again, in the early stages. Like I said, we are doing it very methodically. \\nAnd the objective here is not only to improve our efficiency, but make sure that our customer experience gets better, and \\nthat's what we are focused on. \\n\\nJohn W. Dietrich \\nExecutive Vice President & CFO, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nAnd if I could also, Ken, on that point, as reflected in our CapEx budget of coming down to $300 million, and we're well \\nunderway on Network 2.0, we're staying within budget and looking for opportunities to tighten our CapEx investment along \\n\\n16 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cthe way, too, and that's being reflected in our ability to bring down our CapEx for this year. So, I guess that's a long-\\nwinded way of saying that we're staying within budget on executing Network 2.0. \\n\\nBrie A. Carere \\nChief Customer Officer & Executive Vice President, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nTo answer the question on how are we getting a lower cost structure from economy, the answer is there's multiple ways. I \\nthink here, domestically, on the FedEx Ground Economy, John and the surface team have done an outstanding job of \\nusing surface. We are trying to sort off cycle. We are looking at different delivery ways. From an air freight perspective, as \\nRaj just talked about, we are absolutely increasing our trucking versus flying. \\n\\nIn addition to that, the IPFS as well as the IEF product, we will moving off cycle. So, we're not hitting prime sort, which \\nallows us to sweat our assets. The extra time in transit from an IEF perspective allows us to build far greater dense loads. \\nIt allows us to improve our stackability. It allows us to layer on small parcels when you think about an air freight container. \\nWe are going to load it with airfreight and then top it off with your poly bags from an e-commerce perspective. So, there's \\nmultiple levers we are pulling. In addition, as we talk about the DRIVE growth, we are managing SG&A very tightly. So, as \\nwe take on deferred volume, we know that we cannot have the same amount of SG&A on the deferred yield. So multiple \\nlevers, the team is pulling all of them. And as you saw, it's showing up in the P&L. \\n\\nOperator: The next question is from Ari Rosa with Citigroup. Please go ahead. \\n\\nAri Rosa \\nAnalyst, Citigroup \\n\\nHi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So I was hoping we could revisit some of the longer-term targets, \\nwhether those are the targets that you spoke about at Investor Day or if you want to speak to kind of how you're thinking \\nabout the longer-term opportunity in the business, because you've talked a lot about some of the savings, the progress \\nthat's being made with DRIVE, but here we are kind of multiple quarters in a row where the outlook has been revised \\nlower. \\n\\nSo maybe you could talk about is it just – is the macro that much weaker than expected at the time that you set out those \\ntargets? And then as we think about longer term, maybe you could talk about what level of operating leverage we could \\nexpect to see or what kind of contribution to operating earnings we could see over the longer term as the macro improves, \\ngiven some of the structural improvements that you put in place. Thanks. \\n\\nRajesh Subramaniam \\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nThank you, Ari. When we spoke about this a couple of years ago, we had – obviously had a different expectation on \\nwhere the revenue is going to be. But our goals, if you remember, were improved operating margin, improve our return on \\ninvested capital. And we have accomplished those. The fact that we have done it in an environment where the revenues \\nnow actually came down is, I think, is extraordinarily impressive. \\n\\nWho would have thought that the industrial production would be down 24 over 25 months, in the last 24, 25 months, it's \\njust – that was not definitely factored in. But the fact that the work that we have done to make sure that our structural \\ncosts were reduced and that when we see a turn back, and we will, on the industrial environment, then there is a \\nsignificant leverage that exists in our business. \\n\\nAt the same time, we have also now transformed our networks. And because of – it's not easy to do that, but we are in the \\nprocess of doing that through Tricolor, Network 2.0, the work that we are doing in Europe and other projects, that then \\n\\n17 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0callows us to reduce the overall cost to serve for some of the other segments of the market. International air freight is a \\nclassic case. \\n\\nSo, we now have an opportunity to not only to grow when the industrial economy comes back, but now we have an \\nopportunity to profitably grow in new segments of the market. So those combination of it is what gives me a lot of \\nconfidence as we go forward. \\n\\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Raj \\nSubramaniam for any closing remarks. \\n\\nRajesh Subramaniam \\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, FedEx Corp. \\n\\nThank you. I'm going to just rephrase some of the things I just said to Ari's question, because this is really important. \\nFirstly, though, I just want to take this opportunity to thank the entire FedEx team for the performance that we have \\ndelivered here, and we have significantly reduced our cost structure over the past couple of years. I couldn't be prouder of \\nTeam FedEx as we are on target to reduce more than $4 billion in structural cost by end of FY 2025 versus 2023. \\n\\nWe have outperformed the industry on both top and bottom line over this time period. We have enshrined DRIVE as the \\nway we work. It's an execution framework that will serve us well into the future. We also created a powerful data \\ninfrastructure that serves as an enabler, differentiated and a value creator. \\n\\nWith Network 2.0, Tricolor and other initiatives, we are transforming our networks and making them more efficient and \\ndifferentiated, aided and enabled by the latest technology. So, I said, look ahead, we have a better, more flexible cost \\nstructure that can create significant value as you probably profitably expand the markets where we compete and benefit \\nfrom significant leverage when the industrial economy returns to growth. And these are some of the very powerful reasons \\nthat I feel very confident in the future of FedEx. Thank you very much, operator. \\n\\n18 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c\""
